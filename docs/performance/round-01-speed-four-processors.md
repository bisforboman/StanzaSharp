Summary:
- C# went from 1.6× slower than Python to 1.8× faster at 8 threads.
- At 1 thread, it went from 2.2× slower to 1.9× faster.
- Pos and constituency together account for over 90% of the time. Tokenize and mwt are minor.

## Where the time went (round 1)

Measured with stopwatch instrumentation on the stages and inside the parser.

1. **The charlm ran over padding.** Each charlm is a 1-layer LSTM with 1024 hidden units. It costs
   about 9 MFLOP per character, per direction.
   - `BuildCharRepresentation` ran it over the batch padded to its longest sentence, in characters.
   - The tagger's batches are 250 sentences in document order. One long sentence therefore made
     most of the work padding.
   - This was most of the pos time and a large part of the constituency time.
2. **The charlm ran twice per sentence.** The tagger and the parser feed the same words through
   the same two charlms. Python Stanza does this too.
3. **The parser ran in lockstep batches.** It took 50 sentences in document order and stepped them
   until the slowest one finished. Stanza instead keeps 50 states in flight, sorted longest first,
   and refills the batch as states finish.
   - The lockstep version stepped half-empty batches for a long time.
   - All tensors of a batch stayed in one `DisposeScope` until the batch ended.
4. **Peak memory.** Padding the packed charlm output back to [batch, longest sentence, 1024], only
   to read a few rows, created a tensor of about 1 GB for a 250-sentence batch with one very long
   sentence.

Not worth changing:
- JSON/safetensors loading: 0.7–0.8 s, against Python's 3.6 s.
- Tokenizer array building: the tokenizer is already faster than Python's.
- The parser's per-step overhead. After the changes it is about 2.5 s of the 10.5 s parser time
  at 8 threads, and much of that is the constituent-stack LSTM's own compute.

## What changed in round 1

Each change has its own commit, with numbers measured at the time.

| commit | change | why it keeps output identical |
|---|---|---|
| Pack the charlm input | `BuildCharRepresentation` packs sequences (`Rnn.RunPacked`), as Stanza does, so the LSTM never runs over padding | the LSTM is one-directional and padding follows each sentence, so the positions read are unchanged |
| Parser scheduling | `ConstituencyParser.Parse` schedules like Stanza's `parse_sentences`. Sentences are sorted longest first, 50 states are in flight, and finished states are refilled from the next 50 sentences. Each step gets its own `DisposeScope`. A state's kept tensors are owned by `ParserState` and freed when that state finishes. | each state's computation is independent. The batch makeup now matches Python's. |
| Charlm reuse | `Nn.CharlmCache`: `PosTagger.Process(doc, cache)` keeps each sentence's charlm outputs, and `ConstituencyParser.Process(doc, cache)` reuses them. The cache is keyed by the `Sentence` object, so it never matches across repeated text. The tagger keeps only sentences whose words `simplify_punct` left unchanged. The parser computes just the missing ones. | see the note below |
| `Rnn.RunPackedAt` | the charlm reads its word-end rows directly from the packed output instead of padding it first | pure indexing; values are unchanged |

Note on charlm reuse: the charlm is **not bitwise batch-invariant**.
- In a direct test, 149 of 208 sentences differed in their last float bits depending on which
  sentences shared the batch.
- So the parser's input from the cache can differ from a fresh computation, by about 1e-7.
- That is far below the existing C#-vs-Python drift (parser scores ≈ 2e-5).
- Outputs stayed identical on all golden files and on the 26k-word benchmark text, at 1 and at 8
  threads.
- If an output ever differed because of this, the fix is to drop the cache:
  `Pipeline.Process` would pass `null`.
